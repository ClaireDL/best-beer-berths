# Best Beer Berths

The project is a way of remembering and visualize spatially my favourite places to find amazing beers as well as to give some tools like statistics and distances.

The project is also a way for me to get updated on the current status of HTML, CSS and JavaScript because it's been many years I haven't worked with these technologies.

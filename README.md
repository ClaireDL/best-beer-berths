# Best Beer Berths

To access the map online: [Best Beer Berths](https://rawgit.com/ColOfAbRiX/best-beer-berths/master/map.html).

This project is a way of remember and visualize my favourite places to have great beers as well as to give some tools like statistics and distances.

The project is also a way for me to get updated on the current status of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This is a pure client implementation.
